1. Fix the issue of the file not downloading the transparent image properly onto the device (desktop/android) (Solved)
2. Fix the display on the android screen. It is WAY too zoomed in (Solved)

3. Understand why the segmentation model works on desktop but not on mobile 
Theory on why problem #3 isn't working:
    Model does not produce a transparent image -> no result argument/variable is passed -> no blob is generated -> because there is no blob, no base64 can be downloaded
    Potential solution: Fix the reason why the image produced is duplicated
